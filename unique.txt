##I kept getting this error in cmake. I've tried many things to fix it but couldn't 
find the cause of this issue. Maybe it's my cmake or visual studio version. I hope
it works on your end.##

I tested the project itself on my visual studio and it worked locally.
This on the error message when trying with cmake:
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file '..\Smiley\Debug\smiley_lib.lib'

##I had a blast learning about game engines this semester. I would like
to thank you for teaching this course. Merry Christmas##
